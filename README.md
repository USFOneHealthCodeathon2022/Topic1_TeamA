**Tool for Automating Meta-Analyses of Treatments for Rare Diseases**

This Codeathon project seeks to automate the process of performing a meta-analysis using data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database.  We are creating a tool with an interface that allows users to search this database by disease and treatment.  It uses SQL to query the database and R to perform a meta-analysis.  Finally, it displays the resulting forest plot in the interface.
